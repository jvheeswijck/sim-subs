#Similar Subreddits
##Description
This is my fourth project I began during my studies at Metis 
(a data science bootcamp). It aims to create a recommendation engine
to suggest subreddits. The initial version uses nnmf for topic modelling 
to gauge the user's interests from their reddit comments
and compare them to a database of subreddits.
It uses the topic of users comments and the sentiment to create a list
of recommendations.
 
 Future versions will improve recommendations by incorporating an 
 engagement score and slider for those that prefer to lurk vs those
 that actively post and comment. 
 dditionally, social network integration
is a desired addition however I do not know if I will get
